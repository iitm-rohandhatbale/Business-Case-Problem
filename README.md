# Business-Case-Problem

## Problem Statement
We have the data from an audio book app , logically it relates to the audio version of books. Only each customer in the database has made a purchase at least once.We want to create a machine learning algorithm based on our data that can predict if a customer will buy again from the audio book company.

The main idea is that the company shouldn't spend its advertising budget targeting individuals who are unlikely to come back.So if we can focus our efforts on customers likely to convert again we can obtain improved sales and profitability figures.
